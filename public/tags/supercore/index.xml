      <title>Inside the Kernel: Architecting FMLP for RTEMS 7</title>

      <description>The goal was clear: Introduce the Flexible Multiprocessor Locking Protocol (FMLP) into the RTEMS 7 SMP SuperCore. But bridging the gap between a 2020 research patch and a 2026 production kernel required a massive architectural overhaul.&#xA;The SuperCore Logic I had to introduce two new control structures into cpukit/score:&#xA;FMLPS_Control: Manages the metadata for the Short (busy-wait) variant. FMLPL_Control: Manages the state for the Long (suspension) variant. Unlike the research code which used ad-hoc locking, I aligned everything with the modern Thread_queue_Context.</description>

      <title>How I Crashed RTEMS: The MrsP Experiment</title>

      <description>Before I could even think about implementing FMLP, I had to understand the beast I was dealing with. The RTEMS 7 SMP SuperCore is strict. Very strict.&#xA;I decided to start with a &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; homework assignment: Verify the existing Multiprocessor Resource Sharing Protocol (MrsP) implementation using the smpmrsp01 test suite on the SIS/Leon3 simulator.&#xA;The Experiment I wanted to see what happens when you break the rules. I modified the init.</description>
