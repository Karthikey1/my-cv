      <title>The Upstream Game: Refining the FMLP Port</title>

      <description>Writing code is easy. getting it merged is hard.&#xA;After getting FMLP working, I faced the reality of upstreaming code to a major open-source project like RTEMS. The initial feedback on my Merge Request (!882) wasn&amp;rsquo;t about the logic; it was about the process.&#xA;The &amp;ldquo;Import vs. Port&amp;rdquo; Dilemma My first commit was a giant blob of changes. That is a rookie mistake.&#xA;Reviewers pointed out that I needed to respect the history of the original research code.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Scheduler: Validating FMLP for GSoC 2026 (Part 2)</title>

      <description>In the last post, I talked about how I modernized the FMLP implementation. But writing the code is only half the battle. Maintainers like Gedare Bloom and Joel Sherrill demanded proof that my changes didn&amp;rsquo;t break the math.&#xA;Validation Strategy: Beyond &amp;ldquo;It Works&amp;rdquo; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t just run a &amp;ldquo;happy path&amp;rdquo; test. I had to build a suite that actively tried to break the scheduler.&#xA;spfmlp01: Validates the Long (suspension) variant. spfmlp02: Validates the Short (busy-wait) variant.</description>

      <title>Inside the Kernel: Architecting FMLP for RTEMS 7</title>

      <description>The goal was clear: Introduce the Flexible Multiprocessor Locking Protocol (FMLP) into the RTEMS 7 SMP SuperCore. But bridging the gap between a 2020 research patch and a 2026 production kernel required a massive architectural overhaul.&#xA;The SuperCore Logic I had to introduce two new control structures into cpukit/score:&#xA;FMLPS_Control: Manages the metadata for the Short (busy-wait) variant. FMLPL_Control: Manages the state for the Long (suspension) variant. Unlike the research code which used ad-hoc locking, I aligned everything with the modern Thread_queue_Context.</description>

      <title>How I Crashed RTEMS: The MrsP Experiment</title>

      <description>Before I could even think about implementing FMLP, I had to understand the beast I was dealing with. The RTEMS 7 SMP SuperCore is strict. Very strict.&#xA;I decided to start with a &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; homework assignment: Verify the existing Multiprocessor Resource Sharing Protocol (MrsP) implementation using the smpmrsp01 test suite on the SIS/Leon3 simulator.&#xA;The Experiment I wanted to see what happens when you break the rules. I modified the init.</description>
