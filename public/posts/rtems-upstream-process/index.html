        <p>Writing code is easy. getting it merged is hard.</p>
<p>After getting FMLP working, I faced the reality of upstreaming code to a major open-source project like RTEMS. The initial feedback on my Merge Request (!882) wasn&rsquo;t about the logic; it was about the <em>process</em>.</p>
<h3 id="the-import-vs-port-dilemma">The &ldquo;Import vs. Port&rdquo; Dilemma</h3>
<p>My first commit was a giant blob of changes. That is a rookie mistake.</p>
<p>Reviewers pointed out that I needed to respect the history of the original research code. So, I split the work into two distinct commits:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Import</strong>: Bringing in the original research findings from Junjie Shi et al. cleanly.</li>
<li><strong>The Port</strong>: My specific adaptations for RTEMS 7 (the &ldquo;modernization&rdquo; logic).</li>
</ol>
<p>This structure allows maintainers to see exactly what I changed versus what was original research.</p>
<h3 id="licensing--attribution">Licensing &amp; Attribution</h3>
<p>You cannot just copy-paste code and call it a day. I spent hours verifying that the original research authorship and copyrights were preserved in every single file. Open source runs on credit.</p>
<h3 id="the-final-polish">The Final Polish</h3>
<p>I also had to clean house on formatting. Research code is notoriously messy with whitespace. I sanitized the core logic and test suites to meet the strict RTEMS coding standards.</p>
<p>It is tedious work, but it is the difference between a &ldquo;hack&rdquo; and a &ldquo;product&rdquo;.</p>
